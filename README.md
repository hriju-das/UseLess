## Project Description

A browser extension that hijacks your typing and injects random nonsense phrases into text fields ‚Äî just to mess with you. Totally impractical, slightly chaotic, and 100% useless.

---

## The Problem (that doesn‚Äôt exist)

Typing is boring. The internet is too serious. We aim to solve the absolutely non-existent problem of ‚Äúnot enough randomness in input fields.‚Äù

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Inject weird, fun phrases like `existential burrito` or `banana phone` into text boxes while the user is typing ‚Äî even in fields that appear later on the page.
